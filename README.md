# COP4710-GroceryStore
Database Design final project by Jonathan Svensson and Maggie Liott

Prerequites:
- Node.js (the project was developed against the current LTS release)
- A PostgreSQL instance (the project will connect based on the environment variables provided in a `.env` file
  - Note: for reasons unknown, the `node-postgres` package **does not work** unless the database user has a password that is not blank

Instructions:
1. Run `npm install` from the project root directory
2. Run `npm start` to run the application which can be acessed from `localhost:8080` in the browser
